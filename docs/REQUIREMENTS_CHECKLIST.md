# Requirements checklist: instruction → implementation → evidence

Evidence legend: **U** = automated unit test (see the v1.1 count below) · **E** = end-to-end test: real Express app + real PostgreSQL 16 with Meta mocked at the network layer (see the v1.1 count below) · **R** = rendered and inspected (images/MP4) · **D** = real-database migration test · **S** = must be confirmed on your live deployment (Settings → Deployment self-check / manual staging steps).

| Requirement (PRD / RULES) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| FR-01 business facts, service areas, prohibited claims | **Added** (was missing): Settings → *Business facts*; prompts use only these facts; extra prohibited phrases enforced | E, U |
| FR-02 secure admin auth, rate limits, audit | Implemented; `trust proxy` fixed for Vercel so rate limiting works | E |
| FR-03/04 official Meta APIs, permission-aware ingestion | Implemented; missing metrics stay "unavailable", never zero | S |
| FR-05 raw + normalized metrics with timestamps | Implemented; performance matching now tolerates Meta's `pageId_postId` / video id forms | U |
| FR-06 explainable lead classification | Implemented (reason + score); uncertain → NEW; admin can correct and sees enquiry text | E |
| FR-07 Bangla-first content, zero-paid AI | **Reworked**: Gemini→Groq free chain, reasoning-token fix, validation, Bangla-ratio check | U, S |
| FR-08 image/video assets via local tools | Implemented with sharp + bundled FFmpeg | R, E |
| FR-09 cadence from lead evidence + safe limits | Implemented; **frequency guard now enforced** (`MAX_POSTS_PER_7_DAYS`, `MIN_HOURS_BETWEEN_POSTS` were documented but unused before) | E |
| FR-10 dry-run before live | Implemented; dry-run preview now shows the exact final caption and all checks | E |
| FR-11 publish only via authorized endpoints | Implemented (Page `/photos`, `/video_reels`) | E (mock) / S |
| FR-12 attribution, honest uncertainty | **Fixed**: previously no post could ever be attributed (it expected a numeric post id nobody sends). Now per-post `m.me?ref=` links + comment post matching, with confidence | E |
| FR-13 experiments/decisions persist | Implemented; each published post records format/angle/style; *Strategy lab → What the agent has learned* | E |
| FR-14 emergency pause, immutable audit trail | Implemented; mode changes audited | E |
| FR-15 no paid ads / paid AI | No billing code path exists; only two free providers | U |
| FR-16 exact phone 01886-603858 on every creative, readable | Implemented and **validated before publish** on the banner SVG and on every Reel frame | R, U, E |
| FR-17 Messenger CTA on every post | Graphic CTA + clickable verified link in caption | E |
| FR-18 block publish when phone/CTA validation fails | Implemented (pre-publish checks are blocking) | E |
| Agent Mode toggle always visible | **Added to the top bar of every page** (was Settings-only); confirmation to enable; in-flight note when switching OFF | E |
| Agent Mode enforced on server; fail-safe | Verified; autonomous publish re-checks the mode right before contacting Meta | E |
| Pause on revoked permission / uncertain state / repeated failures | **Implemented** (auto-pause + audit) | E |
| Quota exhaustion handling | Run skipped and recorded; no paid fallback | U, E |
| Duplicate-post protection | Atomic claim of PUBLISHING; unique post ids; no automatic retry; stuck-PUBLISHING guard with human resolve | E |
| Content must pass language/policy checks | Bangla ratio, no invented links/phones/prices/guarantees/testimonials/rankings, profile claims, repeat detection | U |
| Creatives readable | **Fixed**: see "Defects found" #1 and #3 | R |

## Defects found in the ChatGPT build and fixed
1. **Bangla text would not render on Vercel.** Serverless has no Bengali fonts; I reproduced it (all text, including the phone number, became empty boxes). Fonts (Noto Sans Bengali, SIL OFL) are now bundled and wired into the renderer; startup fails closed if they are missing and a glyph-coverage check blocks unrenderable characters.
2. **AI settings were fragile**: a 10-second timeout, a 2,200-token cap that hidden reasoning tokens also consume (so JSON could be cut off), Groq-only, with the weakest-Bangla model first. Replaced (see `AI_MODELS.md`).
3. **Layout bugs** on 3-line Bangla headlines (text touching the phone pill, badge over text, accent bar over letters) and headline wrapping by character count. Now measured with the real shaping engine.
4. **FFmpeg would likely be missing in production**: its binary is located dynamically, which Vercel's file tracing cannot see, and the configured include path pointed at a per-app `node_modules` that npm workspaces do not create (they hoist to the repo root), so the binary was likely absent in production. The binary is now copied to `assets/bin` at build and deployed explicitly; Reels get a silent AAC track and fades.
5. **Vercel entry point** relied on auto-detection between `index.ts` and `src/server.ts`. Now an explicit, pre-compiled function with rewrites, 300 s duration, explicit file inclusion and `rhel-openssl-3.0.x` Prisma target.
6. **Attribution never worked** (see FR-12). **Page's own comments** were treated as leads. **Edited comments** were re-ingested.
7. **Schema drift**: two indexes existed in migrations but not in `schema.prisma`. Fixed and now machine-verified. Added `db:preflight` / `db:verify` for the old-database situation.
8. Missing: business profile, frequency guard, always-visible toggle, auto-pause, stuck-publish guard, Reel status polling, ambiguous-outcome handling, per-post attribution, AI health test, deployment diagnostics.
9. `db` scripts, `DIRECT_URL` required at runtime, Next proxy limited to 135 s (now 285 s with `maxDuration`), login rate limiter behind Vercel proxy, server-timezone day boundaries (now Asia/Dhaka).

## Known limits (stated plainly)
* **Not testable from source alone:** your real Meta Page and token, your Gemini/Groq keys, Graph API v26.0 behaviour at publish time, Meta App Review, the Vercel runtime. Meta calls were verified against a mock that follows Meta's documented request flow; use the staging checklist.
* Model names are config (`gemini-flash-latest` etc.); if Google/Groq retire one, the chain falls to the next and *Test every model* shows it.
* I could not run `prisma generate` with the standard engine in my sandbox (engine downloads are blocked there). The application code was run against real PostgreSQL through Prisma's engine-free client; the standard engine is what Vercel/your machine will use and is the normal, widely deployed path.
* **Correction (v1.1):** v1.0 said a native Send Message button could not be added. Meta's Page Feed reference documents a `call_to_action` on link posts, so v1.1 publishes feed posts as link cards with the button and falls back to photo + link if Meta rejects it. It is verified against a mock only; confirm on your Page. Reels still cannot carry a native button.
* Reel ids: Meta returns a video id; the stored id may differ from the later post id; matching uses id suffixes to cope.
* "Roll back strategies that increase negative feedback" is only partly possible: Meta organic insights do not expose complaint counts, so the agent learns from qualified leads and your corrections.
* Booking outcomes depend on you labelling leads BOOKED.
* Vercel Hobby is non-commercial and daily-cron only; Gemini/Groq free quotas can change.


## Version 1.1: changes requested after the first deployment
| Request | What changed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Reactions/comments/shares show "—" | Root cause: one bundled Meta request failed and the code silently dropped all three. Now each metric is fetched separately and the real Meta error and fix are shown (Page analyzer → Data gaps). Missing permission to add: `pages_read_user_content`, then a NEW token. | U |
| Unique media views always 0 | Meta returns an impossible 0 for posts that have views; now treated as *unavailable*, never as zero, with an explanation | U |
| Posting every 3 days is too slow | Rhythm is now daily with qualified leads, **every 2 days** without (`NO_LEAD_WAIT_HOURS=40`); forecast shown on the Calendar and Overview | U (7 cadence tests), E |
| "What is the Publishing calendar for?" | Page rewritten; shows the next run, whether it will post or wait and why, the last post, and recently published posts | E |
| Could not test Reels | **Create now** (Content studio): choose Post/Reel/agent's choice, preview or publish immediately; safety checks still apply | E (real MP4 upload) |
| Steps ran together in the caption | Prompt requires a hook, one numbered step per line, takeaway and call-to-action; a formatter fixes dense paragraphs; all hashtags are now actually posted (v1.0 dropped all but one) | U |
| Wanted the native Messenger button, not a link | Link-card posts with Meta's Send Message call-to-action, public share page for the card image, safe fallbacks | E (mock Meta) |
| New banner style like the sample; designs must differ every time | 10 layouts × 8 palettes (one modelled on your banner), subtitle line, wide card variant; no layout repeats within 5 posts, no palette within 3 | R, U |
| Owner's real services | Business facts now start from your banner (programs, CUET/CU/CMC, verified teachers); credential claims are allowed only when you list them | U |
| Site slow | Removed the API call from every navigation; browser cache + prefetch; images as cacheable PNGs (list payload ~15 KB per draft → none); Singapore region; lazy-loaded image engine; keep-warm endpoint | E, measured |
| "What do I do / what does it do if it fails or gets no leads" | `docs/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`; dashboard "Needs your attention" list | E |
| Bangla hashtag/vowel-sign bug | Hashtags with vowel signs (#হোমটিউটর) and subject names like গণিত were being damaged by letter-only patterns; fixed and tested | U |

Verification for v1.1: 70+ unit tests and a 52-check end-to-end run (real Express + real PostgreSQL, Meta mocked), a dashboard run through the Next.js proxy (sign-in, data endpoints, PNG delivery, cookie handling), all 10 layouts × 3 sizes rendered and inspected, a Reel MP4 rendered and inspected, and the production build path.
